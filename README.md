# Basic Programs
This repository contains basic programs which are the implementation of the concepts of object oriented programming, using file systems, etc using the C++ language.
This repository has many codes the description of which is given below-
1) EMPLOYEE.cpp contains the basic implementation of classes and object which make use of the object of the employee class.
2) MATRIX.cpp is the code to multiply two square matrices.
3) OPERATOR.cpp is the implementation of the operator overloading in C++, where the increment operator "++" is overloaded and given a      different meaning to be used on the objects of a class.
4) OVERRIDD.cpp is the source code to show the concept of method overridding.
5) QUIZ.cpp is a basic program of quiz system which uses the switch cases.
6) OBJARG.cpp is the program where it is shown how to pass the objects as the arguments to the methods.
7) RETURNOB.cpp shows returning the objects from the functions.
8) SIMPINH.cpp is the implementation of simple inheritence in C++.
9) MultiLevelInh.cpp is the implementation of multi-level inheritence.
10) MULTIPLE.cpp contains the implementation of multiple inheritence in C++.
11) FILE1.cpp is the C++ code which uses basic functions of reading from and writing into the files.
12) FILEPROG.cpp is the code which is used to calculate number of words and number of vowels in a file.
13) FILEOPER.cpp reads the file and converts all the lowercase letters to uppercase and writes the updated text back into the file.
14) Decimal2binary.cpp is the C++ code to convert the decimal number entered by the user to a binary format.
